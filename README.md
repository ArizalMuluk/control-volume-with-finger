# Volume Control Using Hand Gestures

## Description
This project is a volume control application that uses hand gesture detection to change the audio volume. Using the index finger and thumb, the user can turn down or turn up the volume by simply changing the distance between the two fingers. This application utilizes `OpenCV` for image processing and `alsaaudio` to control the system volume.

## Features
- Hand detection using machine learning models.
- Real-time audio volume control based on the distance between the fingers.
- On-screen FPS (Frame Per Second) display.
- Volume bar graph showing current volume level.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- alsaaudio
- FingerTrackModule (hand detection module)
